  description: `Welcome to my portfolio site! I'm glad you're here! I have always had a deep love for technology, and was always amazed by it - from taking Cisco networking in high school, to building my own PCs over the years. However, this wasn't quite enough for me! Learning how to program was something that I always wanted to do, but I never thought I could do it. In September of 2020 as a personal challenge to myself - because 'not being able to do something' just didn't sit right with me - I signed up for a bootcamp on Software Engineering from General Assembly. With a lot of hard work and th growth mindset of "I can do it, I just can't do it yet" I graduated in December of 2020 as a fullstack software developer! Goes to show, put your mind to something and you can do it!`,
