  paragraph1: `Welcome to my portfolio! I'm glad you're here! I have always had a deep love for technology; from taking Cisco networking in high school, to building my own PCs. However, this wasn't enough for me, I needed more! Learning how to program was something that I always wanted to do, but I never thought I could do it.`, 
  paragraph2: `In September of 2020 as a personal challenge to myself I signed up for a bootcamp on Software Engineering from General Assembly. With a lot of hard work and th growth mindset of "I can do it, I just can't do it yet" I graduated in December of 2020 as a fullstack software engineer! It goes to show that if I put my mind to something I can do it!`,
